# SOFAI Tool (AAAI 2025)

SOFAI Tool is a neurosymbolic system designed to integrate fast experience-based decision-making (System 1) with logical, deliberative processing (System 2) through a metacognition module. This package enables developers and researchers to easily instantiate, configure, and extend System 1 and System 2 solvers, log system activities, and visualize solver performance across a batch of problems.

## Features

- **Flexible Solver Architecture**: Define custom System 1 and System 2 solvers with problem-solving methods.
- **Metacognition Module**: A metacognition module that chooses between System 1 and System 2 based on set constraints.
- **Logging and Visualization**: Log solutions, confidence levels, and visualize the activities of System 1 and System 2 across multiple problems.

## Usage

The following examples demonstrate how to use the SOFAI Tool by importing the package as `sofai`.

```python
import sofai_tool as sofai
```

### 1. Importing Required Modules

```python
import random
import time
import pickle
import os
import logging
import sofai_tool as sofai
from sofai_tool.metacognition import metacognition_module as metam
from sofai_tool.solvers import system1 as sofai1
from sofai_tool.solvers import system2 as sofai2
from sofai_tool.solvers import Solver
```

- `sofai_tool`: Core SOFAI framework.
- `metacognition_module`: Handles solver selection logic.
- `system1` & `system2`: Provide base classes for implementing solvers.

### 2. Problem Generation

```python
def generate_problems(n_problems: int, complexity_list: list) -> list:
    pass  # Modify to generate problems
```

- This function is a placeholder for generating a batch of problems.
- `n_problems`: Number of problems to generate.
- `complexity_list`: Specifies the complexity levels.

### 3. Implementing System 1 Solver

```python
class CustomSystem1Solver(sofai1.System1Solver):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def solve(self, problem):
        pass

    def calculate_correctness(self, problem):
        """
        Evaluate correctness by comparing with the expected solution.
        Modify this function based on the expected output format.
        """
        pass  # Modify with actual correctness computation
```

### 4. Implementing System 2 Solver

```python
class CustomSystem2Solver(sofai2.System2Solver):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def solve(self, problem, time_limit: float):
        pass

    def calculate_correctness(self, problem):
        pass  # Modify to compute correctness
    
    def estimate_difficulty(self, problem):
        pass  # Modify to estimate difficulty
```

### 5. Using Metacognition

```python
def plan_solve(problem, run_type) -> None:
    """
    Given a problem instance, instantiate both solvers, use metacognition to arbitrate if necessary,
    solve the problem, and print out the results.
    """
    system1_solver = CustomSystem1Solver()
    system2_solver = CustomSystem2Solver()
    
    context_file = "<name of context file>"
    thresholds_file = "<name of thresholds file>"
    experience_file = "<name of experience file>"
    new_run = False
    
    # Use metacognition to decide the final solution.
    metam.metacognition(
        problem, system1_solver, system2_solver, 
        context_file, thresholds_file, experience_file, new_run, run_type
    )
```

### 6. Running SOFAI Tool on the Problems

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Generate a batch of problems with different complexity levels.
    problems = generate_problems(
        n_problems=5,         # Number of problems to generate
        complexity_list=["easy", "medium", "hard"]  # Generic complexity levels
    )

    experience_file = "<name of experience file>"

    solving_modes = ["s1", "s2", "sofai"]  # Different execution modes

    for mode in solving_modes:
        print(f"Running experiments with mode: {mode.upper()}")
        for problem in problems:
            try:
                print("="*20)
                plan_solve(problem, run_type=mode)
            except SystemExit:
                continue

    # Visualize solver performance
    sofai.utils.visualization.plot_solver_activity(experience_file)
```
